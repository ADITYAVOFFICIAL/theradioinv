                                <h2 style="font-family:Permanent Marker">The Branly detector</h2>
                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">
                                    In 1890, Édouard Branly demonstrated what he later called the
                                    "radio-conductor," which Lodge in 1893 named the coherer, the first sensitive
                                    device for detecting radio waves. Shortly after the experiments of Hertz, Branly
                                    discovered that loose metal filings, which in a normal state have a high electrical
                                    resistance, lose this resistance in the presence of electric oscillations and become
                                    practically conductors of electricity. This Branly showed by placing metal filings
                                    in a glass box or tube, and making them part of an ordinary electric circuit.
                                    According to the common explanation, when electric waves are set up in the
                                    neighborhood of this circuit, electromotive forces are generated in it which appear
                                    to bring the filings more closely together, that is, to cohere, and thus their
                                    electrical resistance decreases, from which cause this piece of apparatus was termed
                                    by Sir Oliver Lodge a coherer. Hence the receiving instrument, which may be a
                                    telegraph relay, that normally would not indicate any sign of current from the small
                                    battery, can be operated when electric oscillations are set up. Branly further
                                    found that when the filings had once cohered they retained their low resistance
                                    until shaken apart, for instance, by tapping on the tube. The coherer, however,
                                    was not sensitive enough to be used reliably as radio developed.

                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">
                                    British physicist and writer Sir Oliver Lodge came close to being the first to prove
                                    the existence of Maxwell's electromagnetic waves. In a series of spring 1888
                                    experiments conducted with a Leyden jar connected to a length of wire with spaced
                                    spark gaps he noticed he was getting different size sparks and a glow pattern along
                                    the wire that seemed to be a function of wavelength. Before he could present
                                    his own findings he learned of Hertz' series of proofs on the same
                                    subject.<br><br>On 1 June 1894, at a meeting of the British Association for the
                                    Advancement of Science at Oxford University, Lodge gave a memorial lecture on the
                                    work of Hertz (recently deceased) and the German physicist's proof of the existence
                                    of electromagnetic waves 6 years earlier. Lodge set up a demonstration on the
                                    quasi-optical nature of "Hertzian waves" (radio waves) and demonstrated their
                                    similarity to light and vision including reflection and transmission. Later in
                                    June and on 14 August 1894 he did similar experiments, increasing the distance of
                                    transmission up to 55 meters. In these lectures Lodge demonstrated a detector
                                    that would become standard in radio work, an improved version of Branly's detector
                                    which Lodge dubbed the coherer. It consisted of a glass tube containing metal
                                    filings between two electrodes. When the small electrical charge from waves from an
                                    antenna were applied to the electrodes, the metal particles would cling together or
                                    "cohere" causing the device to become conductive allowing the current from a battery
                                    to pass through it. In Lodge's setup the slight impulses from the coherer were
                                    picked up by a mirror galvanometer which would deflect a beam of light being
                                    projected on it, giving a visual signal that the impulse was received. After
                                    receiving a signal the metal filings in the coherer were broken apart or "decohered"
                                    by a manually operated vibrator or by the vibrations of a bell placed on the table
                                    near by that rang every time a transmission was received. Lodge also
                                    demonstrated tuning using a pair of Leyden jars that could be brought into
                                    resonance. Lodge's lectures were widely publicized and his techniques influenced
                                    and were expanded on by other radio pioneers including Augusto Righi and his student
                                    Guglielmo Marconi, Alexander Popov, Lee de Forest, and Jagadish Chandra
                                    Bose.<br><br>Lodge at the time seemed to see no value in using radio waves for
                                    signalling or wireless telegraphy and there is debate as to whether he even bothered
                                    to demonstrate communication during his lectures. Physicist John Ambrose
                                    Fleming, pointed out that Lodge's lecture was a physics experiment, not a
                                    demonstration of telegraphic signaling. After radio communication was developed
                                    Lodge's lecture would become the focus of priority disputes over who invented
                                    wireless telegraphy (radio). His early demonstration and later development of radio
                                    tuning (his 1898 Syntonic tuning patent) would lead to patent disputes with the
                                    Marconi Company. When Lodge's syntonic patent was extended in 1911 for another 7
                                    years Marconi agreed to settle the patent dispute and purchase the patent.

                                    not interested in patenting his work. Bose ignited gunpowder and rang a bell at

                                    can be sent without using wires. He sent and received radio waves over distance but
                                    did not commercially exploit this achievement.<br><br>Bose demonstrated the ability
                                    of the signal to travel from the lecture room, and through an intervening room and
                                    passage, to a third room 75 feet (23 m) distant from the radiator, thus passing
                                    through three solid walls on the way, as well as the body of the chairman (who
                                    happened to be the Lieutenant-Governor). The receiver at this distance still had
                                    energy enough to make a contact which set a bell ringing, discharged a pistol, and
                                    exploded a miniature mine. To get this result from his small radiator, Bose set up
                                    an apparatus which curiously anticipated the lofty 'antennae' of modern wireless
                                    telegraphy—a circular metal plate at the top of a pole, 20 feet (6.1 m) high, being
                                    put in connection with the radiator and a similar one with the receiving
                                    apparatus.<br><br>The form of 'Coherer' devised by Professor Bose, and described by
                                    him at the end of his paper 'On a new Electro Polariscope' allowed for the
                                    sensibility and range to appear to leave little to be desired at the time. In
                                    1896, the British, Daily Chronicle reported on his UHF experiments: "The inventor
                                    (J. C. Bose) has transmitted signals to a distance of nearly a mile and herein lies
                                    the first and obvious and exceedingly valuable application of this new theoretical
                                    marvel."<br><br>After Bose's Friday Evening Discourses at the Royal Institution, The
                                    Electric Engineer expressed 'surprise that no secret was at any time made as to its
                                    construction, so that it has been open to all the world to adopt it for practical
                                    and possibly money-making purposes.' Bose was sometimes criticised as unpractical
                                    for making no profit from his inventions.<br><br>In 1899, Bose announced the
                                    development of an "iron-mercury-iron coherer with telephone detector" in a paper
                                    presented at the Royal Society, London. Later he received U.S. Patent 755,840,
                                    "Detector for electrical disturbances" (1904), for a specific electromagnetic
                                    receiver. Bose would continue with his research and made other contributions to the
                                    development of radio.</p>
