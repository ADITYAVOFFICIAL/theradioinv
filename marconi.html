                                    Guglielmo Giovanni Maria Marconi, 1st Marquis of Marconi FRSA (25 April 1874 – 20
                                    July 1937) was an Italian inventor and
                                    electrical engineer, known for his pioneering work on long-distance radio
                                    transmission, development of Marconi's law, and a radio telegraph system. The
                                    Marchese Marconi is credited as the inventor of radio, and he shared the 1909
                                    Nobel Prize in Physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun "in recognition of their
                                    contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy.

                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">
                                    Marconi was also an entrepreneur, businessman, and founder of The Wireless Telegraph
                                    & Signal Company in the United Kingdom in 1897 (which became the Marconi Company).
                                    He succeeded in making an engineering and commercial success of radio by innovating
                                    and building on the work of previous experimenters and physicists. In 1929,
                                    Marconi was ennobled as a Marchese (marquis) by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy,
                                    and, in 1931, he set up Vatican Radio for Pope Pius XI.

                                    Marconi did not attend school as a child and did not go on to formal higher
                                    education. Instead, he learned chemistry, mathematics, and physics at
                                    home from a series of private tutors hired by his parents. His family hired
                                    additional tutors for Guglielmo in the winter when they would leave Bologna for the
                                    warmer climate of Tuscany or Florence. Marconi noted an important mentor was
                                    professor Vincenzo Rosa, a high school physics teacher in Livorno. Rosa
                                    taught the 17-year-old Marconi the basics of physical phenomena as well as new
                                    theories on electricity. At the age of 18 and back in Bologna, Marconi became
                                    acquainted with University of Bologna physicist Augusto Righi, who had done research
                                    on Heinrich Hertz's work. Righi permitted Marconi to attend lectures at the
                                    university and also to use the University's laboratory and library.

                                <h2 style="font-family:Permanent Marker">Radio work</h2>
                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">From youth, Marconi was interested in science and
                                    electricity. In the early 1890s, he
                                    began working on the idea of "wireless telegraphy"—i.e., the transmission of
                                    telegraph messages without connecting wires as used by the electric telegraph. This
                                    was not a new idea; numerous investigators and inventors had been exploring wireless
                                    telegraph technologies and even building systems using electric conduction,
                                    electromagnetic induction and optical (light) signalling for over 50 years, but none
                                    had proven technically and commercially successful. A relatively new development
                                    came from Heinrich Hertz, who, in 1888, demonstrated that one could produce and
                                    detect electromagnetic radiation, based on the work of James Clerk Maxwell. At the
                                    time, this radiation was commonly called "Hertzian" waves, and is now generally
                                    referred to as radio waves.</p>

                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">There was a great deal of interest in radio waves
                                    in the physics community, but this
                                    interest was in the scientific phenomenon, not in its potential as a communication
                                    method. Physicists generally looked on radio waves as an invisible form of light
                                    that could only travel along a line of sight path, limiting its range to the visual
                                    horizon like existing forms of visual signaling. Hertz's death in 1894 brought
                                    published reviews of his earlier discoveries including a demonstration on the
                                    transmission and detection of radio waves by the British physicist Oliver Lodge and
                                    an article about Hertz's work by Augusto Righi. Righi's article renewed Marconi's
                                    interest in developing a wireless telegraphy system based on radio waves, a line
                                    of inquiry that Marconi noted other inventors did not seem to be pursuing.</p>
