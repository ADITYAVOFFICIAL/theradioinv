                                </figcaption>
                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">At the onset of World War I, radio was still in its
                                    infancy. Army equipment was primitive, had a very short range, and often negotiated
                                    atmospheric interference. A 1913 aircraft with a radio, at the time considered
                                    cutting-edge equipment, had a maximum range of 2,000 yards. Military radio equipment
                                    also used vacuum tubes, which were heavy and bulky. As a result, the equipment was
                                    difficult to tote around on the battlefield, even on mules and horses, which were
                                    still the military’s primary mode of equipment transportation. The American army
                                    made some adaptations with the development of a "horse-pack set," which used a hand
                                    generator and was strapped to the side of a horse. The entire radio transmitter and
                                    receiver, in size and design, resembled a saddle.</p><img
                                    src="assets/img/blog/war111.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Radio during World War 1">
                                <figcaption class="bottom-three" style="font-family:Cabin">
                                </figcaption>
                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">

                                    Still, this did not solve all of radio’s challenges. During the First World War,
                                    radio transmissions were often less reliable than using wired telephones or
                                    telegraphs. Radio really found a foothold, however, at sea, even before the United
                                    States’ direct involvement in World War I. President Wilson’s 1914 Executive Order
                                    allowed the Navy to censor international telegrams sent or received via radio.
                                    Though many, including the Marconi Wireless Company of America, vehemently
                                    challenged the censorship ban, it stuck, and so began the Navy’s heavy involvement
                                    with wartime radio. Navy radio stations, which had higher powered signals than those
                                    sent out on the frontlines, were able to relay timely wartime news to vessels at
                                    sea. There was some experimentation with troop entertainment via radio transmission,
                                    too, with broadcasts aimed at Navy ships at sea and wounded sailors recovering in
                                    hospitals. It is telling that the U.S. Navy press sent its final dispatch of the
                                    war, announcing armistice on November 11, 1918, via radio transmission.</p>

                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">Radio was the cheapest form of
                                    entertainment, and it was the most popular medium during World War II. The
                                    accessibility and availability meant it fueled propaganda and could reach a
                                    large number of citizens. Radio helped entertain and inform the population,
                                    encouraging citizens to join in the war effort.<br><br>

                                    One of the most popular shows in Britain during the time, Tommy Handley's It's
                                    That Man Again was able to reach up to 40% of the British population. However,
                                    the success of radio propaganda during World War I, went on to inspire fascist
                                    and social regimes during World War II. Effective radio propaganda arrived in
                                    the form of news reports by Edward. R. Murrow. He covered the Battle of Britain
                                    and nightly bombing raids in London, with his vivid imagery capturing the
                                    nation’s imaginations.</p>

                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">In America, broadcasting was offered twenty-four
                                    hours a day in an effort to keep citizens engaged, and 90% of American families
                                    owned a radio during World War II. However, propaganda was not well received,
                                    reminding citizens of the efforts used in World War I. This led President Roosevelt
                                    and others to attempt to convince the people that the government was not out to
                                    censor information but inform the public. One of the most successful radio program
                                    methods the American government used was the “you technique”. This method put the
                                    listener directly in situations like battle or being in a military camp by
                                    addressing them personally.<br><br>

                                    In Nazi Germany, radio was an important propaganda tool. Just a few short months
                                    after the outbreak of World War II, German propagandists were transmitting close to
                                    11 hours of programming a day, with the majority of the transmissions in English as
                                    well. Their focus was on eroding the pro-British sentiment, and propagandists also
                                    focused on certain groups such as capitalists, Jews, and specific newspapers and
                                    politicians.</p>

                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">Joseph Goebbels, German propaganda minister, called
                                    the radio the “eighth great power”, noting the influence of radio in promoting the
                                    Third Reich. Goebbels approved a mandate in which millions of cheap radio sets were
                                    subsidized by the government and distributed to citizens. Germans also delivered
                                    their messages to occupied territories and enemy states. One of their main targets
                                    was the United Kingdom where William Joyce (Lord Haw-Haw) regularly broadcasted. In
                                    the United States, there were Robert Henry Best and Mildred Gillars (Axis Sally).

                                </h2>
                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">As radio made its impact on the World War II
                                    battlefields, it became essential for Americans tuning in at home. For the first
                                    time, families listening in heard wartime news in real time. On September 3, 1939,
                                    radio listeners heard Britain and France declare war on Germany and speeches by the
                                    UK Prime Minister and U.S. President Roosevelt as they happened. When the United
                                    States officially entered the war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in
                                    December 1941, listeners got an even fuller picture of what life was like on the
                                    battlefront. Most notably, award-winning journalist Edward R. Murrow became part of
                                    CBS News' efforts to bring the realities of the war back home through on-the-ground
                                    radio reporting. Murrow became famous for reporting live from London during the
                                    nine-month Nazi bombing campaign called the "Blitz."

                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">Radio addresses from the front were coupled with
                                    broadcasts from leaders of the warring nations. Roosevelt’s fireside chats, which
                                    began in 1933 and lasted until 1944, became an intimate way for the president to
                                    directly communicate with radio listeners across the United States. During the war,
                                    the president was able to speak about the declaration of war and its progress, the
                                    US economy, and the movement toward peace. The concept and format allowed listeners
                                    to feel like the president was in their homes talking to them, letting them know
                                    they were going to make it through some of the nation’s toughest times.</p>

                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">The war also influenced radio entertainment
                                    broadcasts, becoming a topic in radio serials and soap operas, often with racially
                                    charged caricatures of the Axis powers playing the villains. Government-sponsored
                                    broadcasts featured Hollywood celebrities sharing the virtues of collecting scrap
                                    metal and planting Victory gardens. Children’s programming was no exception. Boys
                                    and girls listening to the popular Dick Tracy series were urged to fight the enemy
                                    by pledging to save water, gas and electricity, and to "save my playthings" as well
                                    as "Mom's furniture."</p>
