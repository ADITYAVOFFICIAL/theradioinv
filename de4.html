                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">
                                    Ferdinand Braun's major contributions were the introduction of a closed tuned
                                    circuit in the generating part of the transmitter, and its separation from the
                                    radiating part (the antenna) by means of inductive coupling, and later on the usage
                                    of crystals for receiving purposes. Braun experimented at first at the University of
                                    Strasbourg. Braun had written extensively on wireless subjects and was well known
                                    through his many contributions to the Electrician and other scientific
                                    journals. In 1899, he would apply for the patents, Electro telegraphy by means
                                    of condensers and induction coils and Wireless electro transmission of signals over
                                    surfaces.<br><br>Pioneers working on wireless devices eventually came to a limit of
                                    distance they could cover. Connecting the antenna directly to the spark gap produced
                                    only a heavily damped pulse train. There were only a few cycles before oscillations
                                    ceased. Braun's circuit afforded a much longer sustained oscillation because the
                                    energy encountered less loss swinging between coil and Leyden Jars. Also, by means
                                    of inductive antenna coupling the radiator was matched to the
                                    generator.<br><br>In spring 1899 Braun, accompanied by his colleagues Cantor and
                                    Zenneck, went to Cuxhaven to continue their experiments at the North Sea. On
                                    February 6, 1899, he would apply for the United States Patent, Wireless Electric
                                    Transmission of Signals Over Surfaces. Not before long he bridged a distance of 42
                                    km to the city of Mutzing. On 24 September 1900 radio telegraphy signals were
                                    exchanged regularly with the island of Heligoland over a distance of 62 km.
                                    Lightvessels in the river Elbe and a coast station at Cuxhaven commenced a regular
                                    radio telegraph service. On August 6, 1901, he would apply for Means for Tuning and
                                    Adjusting Electric Circuits.<br><br>By 1904, the closed circuit system of wireless
                                    telegraphy, connected with the name of Braun, was well known and generally adopted
                                    in principle. The results of Braun's experiments, published in the Electrician,
                                    possess interest, apart from the method employed. Braun showed how the problem could
                                    be satisfactorily and economically solved. The closed circuit oscillator has
                                    the advantage, as was known, of being able to draw upon the kinetic energy in the
                                    oscillator circuit, and thus, because such a circuit can be given a much greater
                                    capacity than can be obtained with a radiating aerial alone, much more energy can be
                                    stored up and radiated by its employment. The emission is also prolonged, both
                                    results tending towards the attainment of the much desired train of undamped waves.
                                    The energy available, though greater than with the open system, was still
                                    inconsiderable unless very high potentials, with the attendant drawbacks, were
                                    used. Braun avoided the use of extremely high potentials for charging the
                                    gap and also makes use of a less wasteful gap by sub-dividing it. The
                                    chief point in his new arrangement, however, is not the sub-division of the gap
                                    merely but their arrangement, by which they are charged in parallel, at low
                                    voltages, and discharge in series. The Nobel Prize awarded to Braun in 1909 depicts
                                    this design.

                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">
                                    Guglielmo Marconi studied at the Leghorn Technical School, and acquainted himself
                                    with the published writings of Professor Augusto Righi of the University of
                                    Bologna. In 1894, Sir William Preece delivered a paper to the Royal Institution
                                    in London on electric signalling without wires. In 1894 at the Royal
                                    Institution lectures, Lodge delivered "The Work of Hertz and Some of His
                                    Successors". Marconi is said to have read, while on vacation in 1894, about the
                                    experiments that Hertz did in the 1880s. Marconi also read about Tesla's work.
                                    It was at this time that Marconi began to understand that radio waves could be used
                                    for wireless communications. Marconi's early apparatus was a development of Hertz's
                                    laboratory apparatus into a system designed for communications purposes. At first
                                    Marconi used a transmitter to ring a bell in a receiver in his attic laboratory. He
                                    then moved his experiments out-of-doors on the family estate near Bologna, Italy, to
                                    communicate further. He replaced Hertz's vertical dipole with a vertical wire topped
                                    by a metal sheet, with an opposing terminal connected to the ground. On the receiver
                                    side, Marconi replaced the spark gap with a metal powder coherer, a detector
                                    developed by Edouard Branly and other experimenters. Marconi transmitted radio
                                    signals for about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) at the end of 1895.<br><br> Marconi was
                                    awarded a patent for radio with British patent No. 12,039, Improvements in
                                    Transmitting Electrical Impulses and Signals and in Apparatus There-for. The
                                    complete specification was filed March 2, 1897. This was Marconi's initial
                                    patent for the radio, though it used various earlier techniques of various other
                                    experimenters and resembled the instrument demonstrated by others (including
                                    Popov). During this time spark-gap wireless telegraphy was widely researched. In
                                    July, 1896, Marconi got his invention and new method of telegraphy to the
                                    attention of Preece, then engineer-in-chief to the British Government Telegraph
                                    Service, who had for the previous twelve years interested himself in the
                                    development of wireless telegraphy by the inductive-conductive method. On June
                                    4, 1897, he delivered "Signalling
                                    through Space without Wires". Preece devoted considerable time to exhibiting
                                    and explaining the Marconi apparatus at the Royal Institution in London, stating
                                    that Marconi invented a new relay which had high sensitiveness and delicacy.

                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">The Marconi Company Ltd. was founded by Marconi in
                                    1897, known as the Wireless
                                    Telegraph Trading Signal Company. Also in 1897, Marconi established the radio
                                    station at Niton, Isle of Wight, England. Marconi's wireless telegraphy was
                                    inspected by the Post Office Telegraph authorities; they made a series of
                                    experiments with Marconi's system of telegraphy without connecting wires, in the
                                    Bristol Channel. The October wireless signals of 1897 were sent from Salisbury Plain
                                    to Bath, a distance of 34 miles (55 km). Around 1900 Marconi developed an
                                    empirical law that, for simple vertical sending and receiving antennas of equal
                                    height, the maximum working telegraphic distance varied as the square of the height
                                    of the antenna. This became known as Marconi's law.<br><br>

                                    Other experimental stations were established at Lavernock Point, near Penarth; on
                                    the Flat Holmes, an island in mid-channel, and at Brean Down, a promontory on the
                                    Somerset side. Signals were obtained between the first and last-named points, a
                                    distance of, approximately, 8 miles (13 km). The receiving instrument used was a
                                    Morse inkwriter of the Post Office pattern.] In 1898, Marconi opened a
                                    radio factory in Hall Street, Chelmsford, England, employing around 50 people. In
                                    1899, Marconi announced his invention of the "iron-mercury-iron coherer with
                                    telephone detector" in a paper presented at Royal Society, London.<br><br>

                                    In May, 1898, communication was established for the Corporation of Lloyds between
                                    Ballycastle and the Lighthouse on Rathlin Island in the north of Ireland. In July
                                    1898, the Marconi telegraphy was employed to report the results of yacht races at
                                    the Kingstown Regatta for the Dublin Express newspaper. A set of instruments were
                                    fitted up in a room at Kingstown, and another on board a steamer, the Flying
                                    Huntress. The aerial conductor on shore was a strip of wire netting attached to a
                                    mast 40 feet (12 m) high, and several hundred messages were sent and correctly
                                    received during the progress of the races.<br><br>

                                    At this time His Majesty King Edward VII, then Prince of Wales, had the misfortune
                                    to injure his knee, and was confined on board the royal yacht Osltorm in Cowes
                                    Bay. Marconi fitted up his apparatus on board the royal yacht by request, and
                                    also at Osborne House, Isle of Wight, and kept up wireless communication for three
                                    weeks between these stations. The distances covered were small; but as the yacht
                                    moved about, on some occasions high hills were interposed so that the aerial wires
                                    were overtopped by hundreds of feet, yet this was no obstacle to communication.
                                    These demonstrations led the Corporation of Trinity House to afford an opportunity
                                    for testing the system in practice between the South Foreland Lighthouse, near
                                    Dover, and the East Goodwin Lightship, on the Goodwin Sands. This installation was
                                    set in operation on December 24, 1898, and proved to be of value. It was shown that
                                    when once the apparatus was set up it could be worked by ordinary seamen with very
                                    little training.<br><br>

                                    At the end of 1898 electric wave telegraphy established by Marconi had demonstrated
                                    its utility, especially for communication between ship and ship and ship and
                                    shore.<br><br>

                                    The Haven Hotel station and Wireless Telegraph Mast was where much of Marconi's
                                    research work on wireless telegraphy was carried out after 1898. In 1899, he
                                    transmitted messages across the English Channel. Also in 1899, Marconi delivered
                                    "Wireless Telegraphy" to the Institution of Electrical Engineers. In addition,
                                    in 1899, W. H. Preece delivered "Aetheric Telegraphy", stating that the experimental
                                    stage in wireless telegraphy had been passed in 1894 and inventors were then
                                    entering the commercial stage. Preece, continuing in the lecture, details the
                                    work of Marconi and other British inventors. In April 1899, Marconi's experiments
                                    were repeated for the first time in the United States, by Jerome Green at the
                                    University of Notre Dame. In October, 1899, the progress of the yachts in
                                    the international race between the Columbia and Shamrock was successfully reported
                                    by aerial telegraphy, as many as 4,000 words having been (as is said) despatched
                                    from the two ship stations to the shore stations. Immediately afterward the
                                    apparatus was placed by request at the service of the United States Navy Board, and
                                    some highly interesting experiments followed under Marconi's personal
                                    supervision. The Marconi Company was renamed Marconi's Wireless Telegraph
                                    Company in 1900.<br><br>In 1901, Marconi claimed to have received daytime
                                    transatlantic radio frequency signals at a wavelength of 366 metres (820
                                    kHz). Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi
                                    House, Rosslare Strand, Co. Wexford in 1901 to act as a link between Poldhu in
                                    Cornwall and Clifden in Co. Galway. His announcement on 12 December 1901, using a
                                    152.4-metre (500 ft) kite-supported antenna for reception, stated that the message
                                    was received at Signal Hill in St John's, Newfoundland (now part of Canada) via
                                    signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at Poldhu, Cornwall. The
                                    message received had been prearranged and was known to Marconi, consisting of the
                                    Morse letter 'S' – three dots. Bradford has recently contested the reported success,
                                    however, based on theoretical work as well as a reenactment of the experiment. It is
                                    now well known that long-distance transmission at a wavelength of 366 meters is not
                                    possible during the daytime, because the skywave is heavily absorbed by the
                                    ionosphere.[citation needed] It is possible that what was heard was only random
                                    atmospheric noise, which was mistaken for a signal, or that Marconi may have heard a
                                    shortwave harmonic of the signal. The distance between the two points was
                                    about 3,500 kilometres (2,200 mi).<br><br>

                                    The Poldhu to Newfoundland transmission claim has been criticized. There are
                                    various science historians, such as Belrose and Bradford, who have cast doubt that
                                    the Atlantic was bridged in 1901, but other science historians have taken the
                                    position that this was the first transatlantic radio transmission. Critics have
                                    claimed that it is more likely that Marconi received stray atmospheric noise from
                                    atmospheric electricity in this experiment. The transmitting station in Poldhu,
                                    Cornwall used a spark-gap transmitter that could produce a signal in the medium
                                    frequency range and with high power levels.<br><br>

                                    Marconi transmitted from England to Canada and the United States. In this
                                    period, a particular electromagnetic receiver, called the Marconi magnetic
                                    detector or hysteresis magnetic detector, was developed further by Marconi
                                    and was successfully used in his early transatlantic work (1902) and in many of the
                                    smaller stations for a number of years. In 1902, a Marconi station was
                                    established in the village of Crookhaven, County Cork, Ireland to provide marine
                                    radio communications to ships arriving from the Americas. A ship's master could
                                    contact shipping line agents ashore to enquire which port was to receive their cargo
                                    without the need to come ashore at what was the first port of landfall. Ireland
                                    was also, due to its western location, to play a key role in early efforts to send
                                    trans-Atlantic messages. Marconi transmitted from his station in Glace Bay, Nova
                                    Scotia, Canada across the Atlantic, and on 18 January 1903 a Marconi station sent a
                                    message of greetings from Theodore Roosevelt, the President of the United States, to
                                    the King of the United Kingdom, marking the first transatlantic radio transmission
                                    originating in the United States.</p>

                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">In 1904, Marconi inaugurated an ocean daily
                                    newspaper, the Cunard Daily Bulletin, on
                                    the R.M.S. "Campania." At the start, passing events were printed in a little
                                    pamphlet of four pages called the Cunard Bulletin. The title would read Cunard Daily
                                    Bulletin, with subheads for "Marconigrams Direct to the Ship." All the
                                    passenger ships of the Cunard Company were fitted with Marconi's system of wireless
                                    telegraphy, by means of which constant communication was kept up, either with other
                                    ships or with land stations on the eastern or western hemisphere. The RMS Lucania,
                                    in October 1903, with Marconi on board, was the first vessel to hold communications
                                    with both sides of the Atlantic. The Cunard Daily Bulletin, a thirty-two page
                                    illustrated paper published on board these boats recorded news received by wireless
                                    telegraphy, and was the first ocean newspaper. In August 1903, an agreement was made
                                    with the British Government by which the Cunard Co. were to build two steamers, to
                                    be, with all other Cunard ships, at the disposal of the British Admiralty for hire
                                    or purchase whenever they might be required, the Government lending the company
                                    £2,600,000 to build the ships and granting them a subsidy of £150,000 a year. One
                                    was the RMS Lusitania and another was the RMS Mauritania.<br><br>

                                    Marconi was awarded the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun for
                                    contributions to radio sciences. Marconi's demonstrations of the use of radio for
                                    wireless communications, equipping ships with life saving wireless
                                    communications, establishing the first transatlantic radio service, and
                                    building the first stations for the British shortwave service, have marked his place
                                    in history.<br><br>

                                    In June and July 1923, Marconi's shortwave transmissions took place at night on 97
                                    meters from Poldhu Wireless Station, Cornwall, to his yacht Elettra in the Cape
                                    Verde Islands. In September 1924, Marconi transmitted during daytime and nighttime
                                    on 32 meters from Poldhu to his yacht in Beirut. In July 1924, Marconi entered into
                                    contracts with the British General Post Office (GPO) to install telegraphy circuits
                                    from London to Australia, India, South Africa and Canada as the main element of the
                                    Imperial Wireless Chain. The UK-to-Canada shortwave "Beam Wireless Service" went
                                    into commercial operation on 25 October 1926. Beam Wireless Services from the UK to
                                    Australia, South Africa and India went into service in 1927. Electronic components
                                    for the system were built at Marconi's New Street wireless factory in
                                    Chelmsford.<br><br>

                                <p style="font-family:Space Grotesk">John Stone Stone labored as an early telephone
                                    engineer and was influential in
                                    developing wireless communication technology, and holds dozens of key patents in the
                                    field of "space telegraphy". Patents of Stone for radio, together with their
                                    equivalents in other countries, form a very voluminous contribution to the patent
                                    literature of the subject. More than seventy United States patents have been granted
                                    to this patentee alone. In many cases these specifications are learned contributions
                                    to the literature of the subject, filled with valuable references to other sources
                                    of information.<br><br>

                                    Stone has had issued to him a large number of patents embracing a method for
                                    impressing oscillations on a radiator system and emitting the energy in the form of
                                    waves of predetermined length whatever may be the electrical dimensions of the
                                    oscillator. On February 8, 1900, he filed for a selective system in U.S. Patent
                                    714,756. In this system, two simple circuits are associated inductively, each having
                                    an independent degree of freedom, and in which the restoration of electric
                                    oscillations to zero potential the currents are superimposed, giving rise to
                                    compound harmonic currents which permit the resonator system to be syntonized with
                                    precision to the oscillator.<br><br> Stone's system, as stated in U.S. Patent
                                    714,831,
                                    developed free or unguided simple harmonic electromagnetic signal waves of a
                                    definite frequency to the exclusion of the energy of signal waves of other
                                    frequencies, and an elevated conductor and means for developing therein forced
                                    simple electric vibrations of corresponding frequency.<br><br> In these patents
                                    Stone
                                    devised a multiple inductive oscillation circuit with the object of forcing on the
                                    antenna circuit a single oscillation of definite frequency. In the system for
                                    receiving the energy of free or unguided simple harmonic electromagnetic signal
                                    waves of a definite frequency to the exclusion of the energy of signal waves of
                                    other frequencies, he claimed an elevated conductor and a resonant circuit
                                    associated with said conductor and attuned to the frequency of the waves, the energy
                                    of which is to be received.<br><br> A coherer made on what is called the Stone
                                    system was employed in some of the portable wireless outfits of the United
                                    States Army. The Stone Coherer has two small steel plugs between which are placed
                                    loosely packed carbon granules. This is a self-decohering device; though not as
                                    sensitive as other forms of detectors it is well suited to the rough usage of
                                    portable outfits</p>
